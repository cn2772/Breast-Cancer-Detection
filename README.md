# Breast-Cancer-Detection

 Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases worldwide, necessitating efficient diagnostic tools for early detection and classification of tumors. Accurate classification of tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) is crucial for guiding treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes. With the increasing availability of medical data, machine learning techniques—particularly Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)—have shown promise in aiding cancer diagnosis by analyzing patterns in cellular data that may be challenging for traditional methods to discern.
In this study, we use an ANN model to classify breast cancer tumors based on features extracted from cell nuclei in breast mass tissue. The model is trained using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the sklearn library, which provides 30 attributes such as mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness of the cell nuclei. These features enable the model to differentiate between malignant and benign tumors based on cellular characteristics.
The ANN is designed with a straightforward architecture to achieve high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Following data preprocessing steps, including standardization and data splitting, the model is trained to recognize patterns within the dataset that correlate with malignancy or benignity. By doing so, the model effectively learns to classify new, unseen data samples, supporting its potential use in real-world diagnostic settings.
This project aims to showcase the capabilities of ANNs in the domain of medical diagnostics, where reliable classification can significantly enhance the quality of care. The study also outlines software and algorithmic requirements, offering insights into the model’s development process and potential areas for improvement.
